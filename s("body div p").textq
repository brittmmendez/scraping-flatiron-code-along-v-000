While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinarâ€™s blood-soaked past and stand togetherâ€”and unless Dalinar himself can confront that pastâ€”even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson The Cosmere  The Stormlight Archive The Way of Kings Words of Radiance Edgedancer (Novella) Oathbringer   The Mistborn trilogy Mistborn: The Final Empire The Well of Ascension The Hero of Ages  Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series Alloy of Law Shadows of Self Bands of Mourning Collection Arcanum Unbounded Other Cosmere novels Elantris Warbreaker The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians The Scrivener's Bones The Knights of Crystallia The Shattered Lens The Dark Talent The Rithmatist series The Rithmatist Other books by Brandon Sanderson The Reckoners Steelheart Firefight CalamityAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.Enter your mobile number or email address below and we'll send you a link to download the free Kindle App. Then you can start reading Kindle books on your smartphone, tablet, or computer - no Kindle device required.

There is simply no other way to describe what he's managed to pull off in this transcendent final volume of his Mistborn trilogy.[1;35m\"[0m[31m â€•RT Book Reviews (Gold Medal, Top Pick!) on The Hero of Ages[1;35m\"[0m[31mIt's rare for a fiction writer to have much understanding of how leadership works and how love really takes root in the human heart. Sanderson is astonishingly wise.[1;35m\"[0m[31m â€•Orson Scott Card[1;35m\"[0m[31mSanderson is crafting an extremely well-thought out saga with Mistborn, one that looks to stand above the pack of his literary peers. The magic system is perfectly detailed, the world, though not completely revealed, has a great sense of natural logic to it, and the characters are a reflection of both.[1;35m\"[0m[31m â€•SFF World[1;35m\"[0m[31mIntrigue, politics, and conspiracies mesh complexly in a world Sanderson realizes in satisfying depth and peoples with impressive characters.[1;35m\"[0m[31m â€•Booklist on Mistborn[1;35m\"[0m[31mHighly recommended to anyone hungry for a good read.[1;35m\"[0m[31m â€•Robin Hobb on Mistborn[1;35m\"[0m[31mEnjoyable, adventurous read.[1;35m\"[0m[31m â€•Locus on MistbornThere's a problem loading this menu right now.Learn more about Amazon Prime.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m
